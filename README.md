# Agricultural-Robot-Simulation-for-Tree-Nursery-Inspection
A computer simulation of a mobile robot inspecting a tree nursery. The robot, equipped with GPS, wheel odometry, and a 2D LiDAR, must traverse orchard rows, detect and localize trees, estimate trunk diameters, and output a per‑tree report for grower decision‑making.
